'''Hello everyone and welcome back to Python Basics on Pydroid3 with Melusi Makola! In this lesson, we will continue where we left of on our previous episode. If you haven't watched it, you can find it on my channel under Python Basics on Pydroid 3. Okay let's get coding!'

Lesson Structure:

2.Writing Your First Python Program
3.Variables and Data Types
4.Basic Operations
5.Conditional Statements
6.Loops
7.Conclusion and Next Steps


#5. Conditional Statements
#If Statements

''Definition: An if statement checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.
Syntax: Introduce the syntax of an if statement in Python:   if condition:
Example: Provide an example of using an if statement to check if a number is positive.'''

'''number = int(input("Enter Number:  "))
if number > 0:
    print("Number is positive")'''

#If-Else Statements

'''Definition: An if-else statement checks a condition and executes one block of code if the condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.
Syntax: Introduce the syntax of an if-else statement in Python: if condition: else:
Example: Provide an example of using an if-else statement to check if a number is even or odd.'''

#Nested If Statements

'''Definition: Nested if statements are if statements inside other if statements.
Syntax: Introduce the syntax of nested if statements in Python.
Example: Provide an example of using nested if statements to check multiple conditions.'''

#Elif Statements

'''Definition: An elif statement allows us to check multiple conditions without using nested if statements.
Syntax: Introduce the syntax of an elif statement in Python: elif condition:
Example: Provide an example of using elif statements to check multiple conditions.'''

#Practice Examples

'''Interactive Examples: Engage learners with interactive examples demonstrating the usage of if, if-else, nested if, and elif statements.
Code Snippets: Provide code snippets for learners to practice writing conditional statements in Python.'''


#6. Loops
#For Loops

'''Definition: A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.
Syntax: Introduce the syntax of a for loop in Python: for item in sequence:
Example: Provide an example of using a for loop to iterate over a list of numbers and print each number.'''

#Range Function

'''Definition: Explain that the range function generates a sequence of numbers that can be used in for loops.
Syntax: Introduce the syntax of the range function: range(start, stop, step)
Example: Provide an example of using the range function in a for loop to iterate over a sequence of numbers.'''

#While Loops

'''Definition: A while loop is used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
Syntax: Introduce the syntax of a while loop in Python: while condition:
Example: Provide an example of using a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.'''

#Break and Continue Statements

'''Break Statement: The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely.
Continue Statement: The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.
Examples: Provide examples of using break and continue statements in loops.'''

'''Definition: Nested loops are loops inside other loops.
Syntax: Introduce the syntax of nested loops in Python.
Example: Provide an example of using nested loops to iterate over a 2D list.'''

#Practice Examples

'''Interactive Examples: Engage learners with interactive examples demonstrating the usage of for loops, while loops, break, continue, and nested loops.
Code Snippets: Provide code snippets for learners to practice writing loops in Python.'''

#7. Conclusion and Next Steps
