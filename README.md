# python_basics_on_pydroid3
Here I have put the documents that are in line with my YouTube series "Python Basics on Pydroid 3". In the series I go through some beginner concepts and I will also be posting snippets of code on my social media. My aim is to master these concepts by teaching them.

To get the best from this you should follow along with series on youtube.
